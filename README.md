**👋 Welcome!**
I'm Vincent Lamy, a Data Analyst currently pursuing an **MSc in Data for Finance at Albert School / Mines Paris PSL**. With a unique background combining entrepreneurship, project management, and a growing specialization in data science applied to finance, I bring both strategic thinking and hands-on technical skills to the table.

**🧠 What I Do**
- Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, Numpy), SQL (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), DBT
- Data Visualization: Power BI, Looker Studio, Tableau
- Machine Learning (Intro): Scikit-learn, stochastic modeling, regression
- Cloud & Workflow: GCP, Git/GitHub, modular data pipelines

**🔍 Current Focus**
I'm passionate about financial data, risk modeling, and market analysis. I build tools and dashboards to optimize decision-making, including:
- A stochastic forecast engine for Bitcoin
- A comparative analysis of retirement systems (pay-as-you-go vs funded)
- Book summarization pipelines using NLP techniques
- Custom Power BI dashboards for investment tracking

🎓 Teaching & Training
As a Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon Bordeaux, I supported 30+ students in learning Python, SQL, and data storytelling through business cases and real-world datasets.

🏗️ Previous Life
Before switching to data, I spent over 10 years in the construction industry. I ran my own company, managed multi-step projects, optimized budgets, and even built my own house—an experience that taught me problem-solving, client focus, and full accountability.
