👋 Hi, I'm Vincent, a Data Analyst with a background in woodworking and project management.

🛢️ I honed my data skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization during my training at Le Wagon Bordeaux.

🛠️ I bring over 10 years of experience as an independent contractor, specializing in construction and tailored client solutions.

📈 I combine my new expertise in data analytics with my entrepreneurial experience to drive efficient, data-driven decisions.

🏠 Passionate about real estate, I built my own house from scratch, overseeing every aspect from planning to completion.
